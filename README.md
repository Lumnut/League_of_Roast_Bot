# League_of_Roast_Bot
Simple discord bot used for my channel

League_of_Roast_Bot is developed for fun for my personal discord channel, its primary purpose is to redirect users who try to interact with a music bot in any channel that isnt the musicSpamChannel.

Discord permissions already prevent the music bot from working in other channels, however it relays no feedback of that back to the user. This bot relays that feedback back to the user.

For funsies, it also provides a randomly generated roast if a user requests ones by sending a message to anywhere in the discord channel saying "roast me"


For hosting, I have this running off a rasberry pi
